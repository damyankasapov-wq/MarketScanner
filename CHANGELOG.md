# Changelog

All notable changes to MarketScanner are documented here.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy for SPY, QQQ, and GLD — monitors 09:30–10:30 ET
  range, fires email alert when price closes above or below the box
- Finnhub WebSocket live feed with tick-to-OHLCV aggregation, exponential backoff
  reconnect, and yfinance fallback after 5 consecutive failures
- PostgreSQL state store (via Docker Compose) for cooldown tracking and signal history,
  restart-safe with `SimpleConnectionPool`
- Email alerts via Gmail SMTP with inline chart PNG attachment
- Live candlestick chart using mplfinance — ORB window shaded, box levels dotted,
  signal markers pinned to exact breakout bars
- Backtest mode (`python main.py --backtest SYMBOL`) — replays today's yfinance data
  and saves chart to `output/backtest/`
- `.env` configuration for all credentials (Finnhub API key, Gmail, PostgreSQL)
- 11 unit tests covering all ORB strategy state machine paths including exact-touch
  boundary, empty DataFrame, and BUILDING→WATCHING transition

### Changed
- Chart title now includes the data date (`SPY — Opening Range Breakout  2026-06-05`)
- Backtest charts saved to `output/backtest/` instead of project root
- `tmp/` directory available for transient files; both excluded from git
- DB default host updated to `openmediavault.local` in `.env.example`
